// FAQs
export const FAQS: FAQ[] = [
  {
    question: "What is the minimum order quantity?",
    answer: "For embroidery, our minimum order is 6 pieces. For screen printing, our minimum is 12 pieces. Digital printing (DTG) has no minimum and is perfect for small orders or one-offs."
  },
  {
    question: "What file formats do you accept for artwork?",
    answer: "For best results, we prefer vector formats (AI, EPS, PDF) with text converted to outlines. For printing, we can also work with high-resolution JPG or PNG files (300 dpi or higher). Our design team can help convert or recreate artwork if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get a price quote?",
    answer: "You can request a quote through our contact form, by phone, or by email. Please include details about your project such as quantity, garment type, number of colors/thread colors, design size, and timeline."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the price?",
    answer: "Our pricing typically includes the garment, decoration (embroidery or printing), basic digitizing or screen setup, and standard packaging. Additional services like custom packaging, hang tags, or expedited production may incur additional charges."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer samples before placing a large order?",
    answer: "Yes, we recommend ordering a pre-production sample for larger orders. Sample costs depend on the item and decoration method but are typically credited toward your final order."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for embroidered or printed garments?",
    answer: "For embroidered items, we recommend washing inside-out in cold water and hanging to dry or tumble drying on low heat. For printed items, avoid high heat drying and harsh detergents to maintain print quality. Detailed care instructions are included with your order."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match specific thread or ink colors?",
    answer: "Yes, we can match specific Pantone colors for both thread and ink. For critical color matching, we recommend ordering a physical sample first."
